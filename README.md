# 👋 Hello

Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I’m a software developer focused on building structured, scalable, and maintainable systems.  
Most of my work revolves around backend engineering, business logic design, and workflow-driven applications.

## 🧠 About

I enjoy designing systems where:

- Business rules are explicit and testable  
- Architecture supports long-term evolution  
- Complexity is controlled, not hidden  
- Performance is measured, then optimized  

My primary interest areas include:

- Backend architecture
- ERP-style systems
- Workflow & rule engines
- API design
- Developer tooling
- Local AI integrations
